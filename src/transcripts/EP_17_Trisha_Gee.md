**Michaela:**: [00:00:00] Hello, and welcome to the software engineering unlocked
podcast. I'm your host, dr. McKay. And today I have the pleasure to talk to
Trisha Gee. Trisha is the lead of the Java development advocacy team at
JetBrains. She's an expert for Java high-performance systems and developed
software for a variety of industries, such as finance or manufacturing.
She's also involved in open source and speaks at many different conferences. As
I'm a huge fan of JetBrains. And I always tinkered with the idea of applying there,
I'm super thrilled to get an insider's perspective from her on how it is to work
there and how she experienced the hiring process. But before I welcome Trisha, I
wanted to give you some updates on my code review workshops. Well, at the beginning of
the Corona virus outbreak, it looked really dark for my workshops. All my
inhouse events have been canceled and postponed. Yeah, understandably. Right?
But the good news is that technology nowadays is so empowering. And so I can now
say that I successfully transitioned to online remote workshops.
I've worked with quite a few people over the last weeks and I start love this new
remote setting. In the upcoming month, I will work with over 60 engineers from companies
around the world. So if you want to make your code reviews fast and
effective, have a look at my workshop at michaelagreiler.com/workshops. I will also
link that in the description, but now let's get back to Trisha.
Trisha, thank you so much for joining my show.

**Trisha:**: [00:01:30] It's my pleasure. Thank you for having me.

**Michaela:**: [00:01:32] So Tricia, I'd like to know a little bit more
about your journey. How did you actually get started in tech and what brought
you to JetBrains?

**Trisha:**: [00:01:41] Um, how much time do you have? (laughs)
My parents were teachers and they thought back in the eighties, they thought
that computers were probably a good thing to be involved with. And
although we can afford our own computers, they would borrow computers from
school to bring back home over the summer holidays and encouraged me and my
sister to look at programming and, and getting into computer stuff.
So quite early on probably about when I was nine or ten, I was sort of
programming, uh, with basic on a BBC micro, I kind of forgot about computers for
a few years up until I was about fifteen, sixteen, and trying to decide on the next
subjects I was going to take at school. And, um, I don't remember why I decided
to take computing, but I decided to go with mass physics and computing because,
uh, well, computers are kind of cool and I like playing games and I, I kind of
liked the programming side of stuff.
So, um, and it seemed a lot better than, uh, what were the other options. I was
thinking about doing maybe chemistry or maybe some more maths. And I thought I'd
rather go broad than deep. So I picked computing with the intention of doing
physics at university, but then I really liked the computing side of stuff.
So I studied computer science at university instead of doing physics. And I kind
of went from there really. I did do, um, I did a placement year, between
second and third year at university, where I worked at Ford motor company, I'm
actually doing programming. So that was like a major step for me to sort of
figure out what it was really like to work in industry.
And also to sort of see how my degree did or did not map well to the sorts of
skills that we needed to industry. Um, it was really interesting cause the
topics I was really interested in back in 2000 where like, um, the AI side of
stuff degree was truant, computer science and artificial intelligence. And I was
really interested in the artificial intelligence stuff.
The, the community vision stuff. Um, I was interested in, we learnt Java at
university, so I was interested in that, but those things weren't used at work.
What was used at work was this stuff that I didn't like, which was the software
engineering courses and the databases courses and the object oriented design
stuff.
And so for my third year, when I went back, I went and refocused a lot of my
choices on stuff that was applicable to sort of daily working as a programmer.

**Michaela:**: [00:03:57] So you said that you're not, you didn't like the
software engineering part of it. Has that changed over time? Do you like it more
now? Or is that something that--

**Trisha:**: [00:04:04] I--

**Michaela:**: [00:04:05] stuck with you? And you're not the fond of?

**Trisha:**: [00:04:08] I didn't get it at university when we were studying,
bearing in mind that my, my. My parents are teachers. And so I had no real-world
industry experience. I didn't know what office jobs were like. I didn't
understand how businesses worked. I didn't understand any of that stuff. I knew
how schools worked.
Cause I went to school and my parents taught at schools. So when they're doing
like software engineering and the courses were those two main courses, I
remember disliking intensely. One was auditorial design and the other was
software engineering, which were coincidentally taught by the same teacher. So
maybe there's some of that.
Um, but I didn't really understand that they were teaching us waterfall
development. So I didn't really understand. I'm sort of a, I've been doing
programming for like on and off for about 10 years. I kinda got the coding bit.
I didn't understand how to do, like, requirements analysis, technical design, um,
you know, any of the sort of waterfall type development stuff.
I didn't understand what I was doing in terms of like "What is the thing I'm
trying to fix? How do I, what's the problem I'm trying to solve? How do I break
it down into a technical technical specification or whatever?" I didn't really
see the value in any of that. I'm just like, just tell me what I need to do and
I'll code it.
Um, and I didn't see the, the value in. Things like boots diagrams and UML,
and, and I just, I didn't get that stuff. And when I was working in industry, I
was like, "Oh right!" Well, some of this, a lot of this is around coordination of
teams. A lot of this is around. Um, we need to, you ask another person what
they're requirements are, we need to write that down.
So we share that with other people. We need to have some idea of upfront design
because it's not necessarily me who's going to be coding it. We need to share
that amongst the team. So sort of seeing those things in motion, made it a lot
less boring and a lot more like, right. I understand it. You know? And, and it
turns out things like documentation, requirements gathering, prototyping,
technical design was actually something I was actually quite good at because
I like writing stuff down.
And I like explaining things, which is why I ended up being a developer
advocate. So, um, Yeah. Once I knew what the purpose was and what the value was,
then all of that stuff sort of became much more interesting and important.

**Michaela:**: [00:06:17] Yeah. I can totally relate to that because when I
think back off my university and when I started, um, studying. Right.
It was quite a different journey because it had nothing
to do with programming, so I was doing actually art school. And so we didn't
use computers at that time. Uh, if you wanted to write, you know, your, your
German, uh, exercises, for example, in word, that would be a big thing, right?
No, you had to do it on paper, with the pen! And write it down. Right?
So they were very romantic about everything like that.
And then I decided to go for university and study Computer
science. And so one of the first courses that I did was actually introduction to
programming. And so we learned Java as well. And we learned, you know, what is a
For Loop and everything. Right?
So at the end, I was quite okay with the syntax, writing little programs and
things like that. And then the second term, after that already, we had what
was called software engineering one. And what we learned were designed patterns.
And I had no idea. This seemed to me like to totally arbitrary, you know?
Yeah. I have no idea what I should do with that. I mean, even though we, we
implemented, for example, a compiler, right? So we were programming or doing
stuff, but there was no connection between those design patterns, for example,
and having the compiler.
You just wrote the compiler in a very, you know, straight forward
way, how you would make the classes and things like that.
But there was no connection between this course and the other course, because
those were two different courses. And then on one hand we learned all these
design patterns that were not applicable for the size of the software that we
were building. Right. So these are all small programs and smaller systems and
they are more really to understand your idea behind, for example, you know,
what is a compiler?
How does it work? Or for example, we also had a little web server or things like
that, right. But we never applied the design principles or design patterns
there. And for me, this was a course that I really didn't get. Um, and it was
really later when I was in the industry, working in industry that I understood:
"Oh, these are designed for veterans and that's why we need them."
So it was very theoretical exercise at that point. And I think that's the
problem. So if it's so, um, detached from reality and from what you know,
and what you're actually doing. So how can you make sense out of it?
And there was, for me, it was this guy out there was just talking some
jibberish, and, oh, whatever, right? (laughs)

**Trisha:**: [00:08:44] Yeah, exactly. I found that a lot. Well, I mean the
programming or guidance. Got the program because I enjoyed the programming for
programming's sake. Right. But, um, a lot of the things I've been thinking about
is I understand why things are taught that way at university, but I often think
wouldn't it be better if you, at least one of your courses was.
Let's call it legacy software development. Right? And you get given a large
system like you're talking about not Qatar, not a pro, not a, not an exercise,
but an existing large system. And the exercises might be something like refactor
this in this direction or add this feature or fix this bug because one of the
things I've come to the conclusion of in the last like 10 years or so is.
Computer science degrees are not, um, apprenticeships for programmers. It's not
the same thing. Now you do learn a lot more on the job, of course. And the
computer science course is not designed to teach you how to be an effective
programmer, it's designed to give you the basics in computer science, but it would
be nice if one of those basics was how to read existing code,
which I have talked about before, but how to read
code, how to, how to write tests to provoke certain types of behaviors, how to
navigate through someone else's code, how to apply a design pattern that you're
talking about in an existing code base. Like what does it do? How does it change
the way it works?
What's the purpose of those things? I've often thought that it would be nice to
inherit code in computer science courses and have some exercises around
inherited code rather than constantly writing stuff from scratch. Cause we just
don't do that in the real world.

**Michaela:**: [00:10:09] Yeah, that's true. And I mean, if you're writing
something from scratch or there's this little thing in the beginning where you
think, Oh, this is hard, right.
But very soon it's easy and it's really fun. And you're just writing your own
system. But it's not, it's not representative of what you have to do in a day to
day job, as you said. And yeah, I looked at one of your talks and it was called
"Reading code is much harder than writing code". Right. And it really reminded me
of code reviews as well.
Right. One of my favorite topics. And so now you're saying it again and I, umm,
so Philippe Hammonds is a professor at university of Leiden. And she does a
lot of research on how people are learning how to program, especially kids.
How are kids learning how to program?
And she says the same thing. She says, "Well, they have to read a ton of things,
right. They have to read programs and they have also to get it by heart."
Like, for example, the, the nitty gritty of the syntax of the language, how do
you make a loop, For Loop? For example, how do you, I have different concepts
for, for the people to really understand the problem that they're solving and
not thinking, Oh, you know, how was that actually in Python?
You know, when I said four, do you have like to have like some, some parenthesis
there or not? You know, something like that, but this is everything is automatic
and you can really focus on, on the problem at hand. And I liked that. Really a
lot. I like this idea, but yeah, as you said, we are not really doing it that
way.
We are doing it that, "Oh, let's drive the hell away." Good. Right. I was writing
a main method right. At the beginning, they would say, "Oh, I forgot everything.
Why, why it's doing or what is it?" Doing just write it down and then right
there, you know, print and hello world and that's it. And then you saw it in
the console, right?
And you are like, "Yes, I'm a programmer now!" And so, yeah, I totally agree that
it would be so beneficial for people to read more code, but you also said in this
talk, is that. People don't like to read code. Why? Why is that by
people not liking to read code, what's what's holding us back?

**Trisha:**: [00:12:09] I mean, whole bunch of
reasons, but one of the reasons why I came up with that talk.
Yeah, well, I was talking with my colleague. Um, and so she speaks a bunch of
like different languages. Um, I'm constantly trying to learn Spanish because I
live in Spain and we were talking about how, how you learn natural languages
versus-- versus, um, programming languages. And I used to work with her when we
were doing code view stuff, actually for the code review tool that we have at
JetBrains, which is why it's all related.
You know, one of the reasons why people hate code reviews is cause you have to
read other people's code and you hate other people's code. Cause you don't
understand it because you didn't write it. And. There's a number of different
reasons why you don't like reading other people's code. One, we just, we don't
practice it very much.
We don't read code at university. Like you say, you get shown "this is an if
statement" or "this is a main method", but that's all boiler plate. That's the crap
that you don't read. That's the stuff you skip over when you're actually reading
someone else's code. That's the stuff you want your eyes to kind of glaze over.
So we should be learning more like the here's here's a bunch of code. Like what
do you think it does? Which when we studied English literature used our
yearbook. And you say, what was, what were the characters feeling? What were
they doing? What are the things in this piece? We don't many do that with code.
We have to do all the time in the day to day job. We have to go, right? What do
we think this code is doing? How do I want to change it obviously, but when
we're learning how to code, we don't really answer questions on "What do we
think this code is doing?" If you're doing certification, it's always some trick
question, like: "Given this really simple looking For Loop, what's really printed
out at the end of it?" So, well that's dumb 'cause I'll just run it.
So I don't really, I don't mean things like that
because anything which is like a compiler trick or something, which you can see
quickly by running something. I think that's dumb. What's more interesting is
you've got big block of code. Like "what do you think this method should be
doing?"
It's almost definitely not going to have an output and input cause it's in a
bigger system. So like what should it be doing? So we don't like to read other
people's code because we don't practice it enough. We don't like to meet other
people's code. Because we didn't write it, and that makes it difficult to
understand.
We don't like reading other people's code because we are conditioned to think
that as developers as programmers, our outputs, our value is in output lines of
code. So we're still not, we're not really measured that way these days. You
don't really measure it on the amount of lines of code that you write, but
ultimately your organization cares about whether you deliver some features,
whether you've fixed a bug.
So we're still internally, we sort of think that our value as members of the
team is about writing lines of code. We don't see the fact that in order to
deliver that feature, we spent 90% of the time reading. We tend to think of that
as a massive waste of time, because all I was doing was reading, trying to find
the place where this bug happened, instead of writing the stuff that fixes it,
we just, we are not valued for, for reading code for, for unassigned stuff.
We feel we're not getting our little gold stars or our tick boxes for, for doing
the reading bit of that. So I think that's part of the thing we just don't
recognize as an industry that although we do probably spend. I'd say 70 to 90%
of our time reading code. We don't see that as value. We just see it as, "Oh my
God, this code must be awful because I had to spend 90% of my time reading it
and understanding it instead of the 10% of my time writing my new lines of code"
instead of accepting "No, that's, that's how it is."
Like if you wanted to, what would be a good analogy?
If you're updating a book, let's say there's an existing, I don't know
a Java book. And you want to add a new chapter to that book on a new feature in
Java. You can't just write that chapter and insert it somewhere, like wedge into
the book.
You have to read the book, figure out like what's the, what the pattern is, what
the flow is, what the, what the structure is, find the right place to put it.
Make sure your prose matches the prose in the book, but you can't just write
something and chuck it in there. Yeah. That's not, that's not how things work.

**Michaela:**: [00:15:55] So during my PhD, I worked a lot on, uh,
code comprehension, so helping people to understand code.
And I think one of the main problems is that reading code is a little bit tricky
because we have only one abstraction. Right? So the code is the code. There
isn't I mean, obviously, for example, in, in an idea, you could then collapse
the things and then it might tell that just the method names and things like
that, but there isn't a lot of granularity there for the abstraction level that
you have. So one of the things that I did during the PhD was, I was building
models, especially also a visual models that help people
understand the code and they were abstracting things. So for example, whatever
it was, the task, there were some of the things that I just skipped, right. So I
thought, well, based on what that person now wants to do on the intent of the
developer, for example, you don't need that information.
And so those methods were really. Trying to help people understand code easier,
because I think it's a very hard task, even if you're doing it very, very often,
it doesn't, it gets easier, but there is still a level of hardness to
it. Right. That doesn't go away. It doesn't go away. What do you think about,
for example, comments and things like that?
I am actually quite a fan of comments. I'm also a fan of having very
readable code. Right. So if you can express it with the code, that's the best,
right. But I'm not opposed on, you know, having any comments there and helping
people read to understand what's actually happening again. Did this starts from
CSS code I'm writing right.
With, if I'm defining something, I write there, you know "what this class does,
where does it belong? Which part of the system is it?" Because it's just making
it so much easier. You don't have to go and figure it out yourself. Right. What
do you think about that?

**Trisha:**: [00:17:37] Yeah. Um, so I used to be a big commenter because I'm
because I've got terrible memory and I can never remember what, what I was doing
in the code and when and why.
And I'm more likely to rework my own code than someone else's code. Cause I'll
come back to it. Go, what is this piece of rubbish? And of course it'll turn
out. This is my piece of rubbish that, you know, I wrote it. And so. Um, for
like the first 10 years of my career, I just spent a lot of the time writing
comments going, okay, well, it has to be this way because this didn't work.
And I tried this and that didn't really work and this piece is trying to do this
sort of thing. Um, so I used to put loads of comments in my code as mostly
memory aides. Um, when I moved to, to Elmax in London and I was working with a
bunch of people who are: (a) doing a lot of clean code, (b) writing a lot of
automated tests, um, (c) excellent developers. Um, (d) not afraid of
refactoring. They said: "we don't write comments in our code."
So I was like: "okay, well, this is going to be a big change for me, but let's,
let's see if I can make this work." And it turned out when I was working. Now I
didn't write a single comment because, well, there's a few reasons. One, we
didn't have the clean code.
It was a bit easier. We'd have really readable tests. We had tests that all
these different levels. So you talk about different levels of abstraction. We
had like acceptance level test right outside and almost. That's of human English
down to unit level tests. So if you didn't really know what was happening or why
you could always look at the tests and they were very readable.
Um, and another thing was, it was fundamental for us to work as a team. This is
the sort of thing that it would be very difficult to remotely. Although we did
have a couple of remote workers. We've had programs every day. So if we didn't
know what was going on, we would always ask the pair, like, what do you think
this is doing?
And they might have worked on it in a pair, or they might know someone who did
it. So we would, everyone was always interruptable to ask like: "You seem to
know what this is, what does it do and why?" And we also had very technical
business analysts sort of like combination between the, an architect and a
business analyst. So when we were like: "what is this module? What is it
responsible for? What's it supposed to do? How's it supposed to work?" We would
always have them white boarding stuff out and saying: "well, this is kind of
how the system's supposed to work. These are how these things work together."
So, um, I didn't really need comments because there were always people to ask
about like what was happening and why it was happening.
And I think that's, that's part of the other reason why code is difficult to
read because even, even these days, there's this idea that we're all lone
programmers and we have to sit in front of the computer and read the code on our
own and understand it on our own. That's why we have to sort of annotate it with
our little notes.
If we are reading, let's say, well, for a start code is huge, right? So it's not
a tiny, it's not a novel. It's not an easily digestible story with like asingle
thread. It's like a massive, uh, I don't, I like an encyclopaedia with 26
volumes where everything isn't, it doesn't have a coherent thread and they self
reference and you can't read all of that to find the right thing.
Um, well you can cause that's ordered, but. The, the, the code bases we're
talking about are enormous, it's not like reading a story. So that means you do
need to do any sort of other human beings and saying: "well, you did this bit,
like, what does, what does that, how does it work? Why is it that way?" So
comments are useful, I think, if you are going to have to work on the code in
isolation.
For example, open source projects where, um, different people were working on
it at different times, the person who's responsible for that code might not even
be contributing anymore. They might not be available on your time zone.
That kind of thing. It's really good to annotate. Like you were saying
the "why's", the bigger picture stuff. Why is this here? What's you know, where
does it belong? What are the, what's the reasoning?
You don't comment the "what", what is this doing? It's a For Loop. It's
iterating it. Doesn't that doesn't need a comment.
What needs a comment of, "why are we iterating? Why haven't we put this into
different data structure that might be more effective", for example?

**Michaela:**: [00:21:24] Yeah. So one of the things I'm giving workshops for
code reviews, for example, and one of the exercises that I do with my
participants is, I give them some piece of code, right.
And I give them a few minutes to look at it. It's not really large it's so one
file, um, a couple of lines of code and they have to try to figure out
what's going on. And everybody sitting and to try and do the thing and to
tinker. And then after maybe five minutes, because we, I don't want to spend a
whole day doing that. Right. I give them the description of the code review,
and this code review description tells them actually what what's happening here.
What's the purpose of that code, you know, and what changed. But it's really,
really hard at the first minute understanding those pipelines, but then once you
give them the explanation behind, suddenly the questions changed completely.
They understand what's happening here. Why is that happening? And then the
question becomes very different. It's like: "is that correct?
Would I would do it in that way?" And things like that. And I find it
really fascinating because yeah, as you said, understanding code is difficult
and if we get some guidance, the whole soft process changes.
So one of the things that I wanted to talk with you about as well is your role
at JetBrains. So talk to me a little bit, how you started getting started at,
uh, with computer and with, with tech, but how did you start at JetBrains? When
did you start there and how did you get into contact with them and things like
that?

**Trisha:**: [00:22:53] Uh, I've been here five years now, which is the longest
I've ever worked for anyone.

**Michaela:**: [00:22:59] (laughs)

**Trisha:**: [00:23:00] (laughs) That's it? Massive record. And so I graduated
in 2001, so I've got like 20 years experience. The first 10 years of my
career. So I kind of stopped the story. Didn't I, when I graduated from
university, the first 10 years of my career, I did what, what I would advise a
lot of junior developers to do, which is like hop around from job to job.
I did like, you know, 18 months here, two years there. I did a couple of jobs
where I was only there for three months and cut your losses fast. That's my
advice. Get the hell out of there. (laughs) Yeah.

**Michaela:**: [00:23:24] (laughs) You don't like it.

**Trisha:**: [00:23:25] Yeah. Yeah. Get out because it's, you know, you can
always, there's always ways to justify that sort of thing: (a), you can
always say I didn't like it, or (b) you can always say it's a contract.
It was just a three month contract, you know? Yeah. Don't be afraid of, of
getting out, particularly for women, if it's a toxic environment, get out
straight away. Yeah. So for the next, for the first 10 years, I kind of moved
around from jobs, job, always doing Java programming, largely like Java and web
stuff.
So there was usually a web front end to it, which sometimes I was involved in,
sometimes I wasn't. Um, then I started working at this company. I just mentioned
Elmax in London. Where for the first time I'd been reading a lot, I'd read
about, um, extreme programming. I'd read about Agile. I'd read it. I did my
scrum master certification.
I read a bunch of stuff by Joel Spolsky. Like I had this idea of how software
development should be, and it worked for a lot of places where it was not
really like that. I mean, I worked for consultancy, which was really good where
I worked at a couple of different banks in London. That was interesting.
'Cause that's where I saw. So does the computing power being used for real stuff
rather than some of the rubbish that I'd seen before. But when I was working at
Elmax, that was a totally different ball game where the people would doing the
stuff that I'd read about. They were doing extreme programming, they were doing
pair programming, they were doing retrospectives.
They would doing continuous delivery before. Like David Farley was literally
writing the continuous delivery book while he was my boss at Elmax.

**Michaela:**: [00:24:51] Very cool.

**Trisha:**: [00:24:53] The book hadn't even been written and we were already
doing it. And so all of this stuff was, was really mindblowing. And I learned
more in the first year there, I learned more than the previous 10 years all
put together.
And at that point I kind of, so I worked there for four years, and my last year,
--well, the last two years really-- I was responsible for doing sort of
their developer advocacy type stuff, because, because why? Because I read a lot.
I was, I was interested in blogs. I was interested in writing blogs.
I'd been to QCon London. At one of my previous jobs, I liked this idea of
conferences. I was kind of involved in the Java, the London Java user group. So
I was kind of involved with people who are part of the bigger community who are
going to conferences. And, um, you know, as part of the job of user group, you
were seeing presentations and meeting a wider range of people. And I thought:
"this is something that I want to be involved in." Um, Elma, was doing
interesting stuff. I want to, you know, enough about what's happening there.
That I can talk about it externally. It's great for us to recruit people. This
is a great place to work. So I was very comfortable going out and talking about
what we were doing and saying: "come and work for us" because I really got a lot
out of working for them and we really needed to, and our team.
So the last sort of couple of years, yeah, I was involved in setting up, um, or
getting everyone started. Well, I knew everyone wanted. Doing some technical
blogs, getting like an aggregator for our blogs so that we had like the Emlax
blogs, adding people who wanted to present from inside Elmax into different
conferences and presenting, and then sort of organizing the people who did that,
organizing their schedules and doing a bit of admin stuff really around that
applying for. You can apply to, to win awards.
I didn't even realize this is how it works. Like they don't just
hand out like prizes, you know, you can submit yourself for various awards in
the industry like yourself personally, or your organization or the code you've
written. And so I was doing a lot of that.

**Michaela:**: [00:24:51] I didn't know about that!

**Trisha:**: [00:26:45] Yeah, I know. Right. So we open sourced a piece of our
software, which is very good for us because it gives
visibility over the, some of the amazing code that we're writing.
So I submitted that to a bunch of like awards and said: "look, this is kind of
cool. Like maybe we should win an award." And then, um, I ended up co-presenting
at Java One with our CTO, talking about this open source piece of software.
And as part of that journey towards the end of it, I'm like, this is what I want
to do.
And at the time I was sort of spending one day a week, doing developer advocacy
four days a week, doing full time, pair programming and developing and stuff.
And. And I was like, I'm not satisfied just doing the development anymore. I
want to do more presenting. I want to, I want to invest more of my actual day
job doing the stuff. I was doing my blog posts at weekends and things like that.
This is like, I was single and I didn't have kids. It was a lot easier to do it.
So, yeah. So I left and I went to go and work for Mongo DB, where they offered
me a role, which was like 50% engineering and 50% advocacy. So that I thought
that was the right blend because I didn't want to move away from the
engineering. Particularly, being a woman in technology, the first question
people ask you, is like "are you a real developer?", "Yes. I'm a real
developer." So, you know, I really wanted to make
sure that I could answer that question truthfully. Yes. I am developing stuff on
the Mongo DB job driver. Um, but over the course of that, um, one year talking
about the Mongo DB Java driver at conferences, and then I realized that my real
skill with this, is it is showing people how to, how to code stuff.
Like I-- I'm, I'm a. I'm a good developer. I'm a solid developer. I really, my
four years working at Elmax. I got to know intelligent idea very well. And I
realize, um, I'd spent 10 years working as like an ordinary developer using my
IDE in a very ordinary way as in not really using it very much. Um, and so I was
demoing how to build Mongo DB applications, using intelligent idea and sort of
showing things like.
Code completion and like templates and all these things that I learned to Elmax
um, when I was paired programming with people and over the course of that year,
then, um, how to use the boss of JetBrains developer advocacy. He kind of came
to me. Well, actually I asked him questions about how to do developer advocacy
in a, in an effective way.

And then he said at the end of that conversation, he's like: "yeah, do you want
to come and work for us?" I was like: "well, it seems a bit rude because I'm
trying to get ideas from you about how to be an effective advocate at Mongo DB."
And so over, like over the course of the next six months, Mongo DB's
direction went in a particular way.
I mean, they are a database company. They have very few Java developers. My
specialty was like coding, Java applications inside the IDE using a Mongo DB
backend, but it really, they, they carried on going in a particular direction
and I saw that my career needed to go in a slightly different direction. So, um,
you know, it was like an amicable breakup, really.
Um, and so he said: "come and work for us." And so I, I went to go and work for
them.

**Michaela:**: [00:29:25] And so how did the hiring process really work? I'm
very, very afraid of hiring processes and, you know, proving myself, even
though I went through several walls, also, these really large. Large
organization hiring like they do at Microsoft, but I really don't like it.
So how was that for JetBrains? How did you experience that?

**Trisha:**: [00:29:44] I, I already had, I had 15
years experienced by this point in time, I was sort of, I was famous 'cause I've
been speaking at conferences. I had a blog and, but it was it's the first job
I've ever not had an interview for. So I was literally headhunted for that role.
I said to Hattie in November: "Yeah. Okay. I'll I'll yes. I'd like to come and
work for you." He's like: "great. Here's your contract. You're starting in
January."

**Michaela:**: [00:30:10] I love that. Yeah. I love that.

**Trisha:**: [00:30:12] But that's-- that's the first time. So I had a lot of
jobs in London, like I said, I've, I've moved around a lot and I was quite
involved in the London Java community.
And even with all of that I'd been using my equipment agents for, for all of
my roles before then I'd have to go through a formal process for all of my other
jobs. But no, that was the first one where they basically, because my, I had a
portfolio by then, I'd already been giving demos on intelligent idea at
conferences I'd already Blogged about how to do stuff. So

**Michaela:**: [00:30:39] That's also a direct show off of what you're going to
do there. Right? It's not something that's a byproduct, but it's, it's your
work, right? So you're actually, you see what you, they are hiring you for.
Right.

**Trisha:**: [00:30:51] It's a very different thing from, from programming. The
programming interviews are 100% broken and I can rant about this for a long
time. If you really want. Programming interviews are very, very difficult.
It's difficult to set and difficult to answer because we really don't know
what makes a good programmer.
And we really don't know how to measure that. And we really don't know how to
demonstrate our value as a programmer.
One of the values I have as a programmer is asking stupid questions. Like: "why
is it doing that?" Right. But I can't ask that in an interview because you
haven't given me an application enterprise application and ask me to fix a
problem. So you can't see what my superpower is. My other superpower is
documenting code that no one else understands because I'm really good at that.
And I like that, but that doesn't come up in interview either. And no one
thinks: "right. Let's go find a developer who can document code that no one else
understands," right? People think I need you to write lines of code. This is why
interviews are fundamentally broken. Anyway, what, what you're getting from real
technical interviews, what you're really getting is it's more like dating.
How does this company work? What, who are the people in this company? What sorts
of things do they value? And who am I as an, as a developer? What sorts of
things do I care about? Like, am I attest first hand? Person or their test first
type of organization. Do I want to be able to pair occasionally, do I need to be
able to ask questions?
Because sometimes I don't know what I'm doing or do I want you to just leave me
alone to do my own thing? So really technical interviews should be more like a
date. Like, what is your style? What is my style? Are we going to get on quite
well? But we haven't really recognized that. For, for advocacy, it's much, much
easier because we can demonstrate exactly what we do.
Like you say, it truly reflects what we do. How do you had seen me presenting a
Java zone? He knew what I was capable of. He knew he'd seen two different types
of at least two different types of my presentations. One is a very opinion based
where I stand up and walk around, like the reading code one that you were
talking about and the other is the live demo where it like live demos are
really difficult and, um, lots and lots of work. Um, but I really liked it
because this again was my way of saying: "yes, I am a real programmer watch me
code." Um, but he'd seen me driving the IDE. He knew that I knew how to use
intelligent idea. He knew that I knew how to demonstrate that to other people.
So like he didn't need to interview me.

**Michaela:**: [00:33:04] What I really find interesting is that you repeatedly
said that you are trying to prove that you're belonging somehow where you are.
Right? And I have the same feeling. I mean, I'm, I'm in technology now for 15
years and, I have the constant feeling still now. Right? Like I did my
bachelor's in computer science.
I did my master's in computer science. I have a PhD in software engineering and
still am like: "yes, I know what I'm talking about. I can program." And I'm
still like, learning like a maniac right now. For example, I'm refreshing my
Java script knowledge. Right. I'm learning a new language. I'm learning now,
Pyhton, because I feel like with Java and Teashop, I'm outdated.
Right? And I want. I have this feeling that I have to prove that I belong over
and over and over again. On one hand, it's it's a little bit tiresome, I feel,
but on the other hand it also keeps you sharp, but yeah, I find it really
interesting that you are also expressing that a little bit. When, when you're
talking about how, how you behaved over the last 20 years.

**Trisha:**: [00:34:11] I feel over the last five years, certainly since I've
been at JetBrains, a lot of that feeling has gone away in a good way. And part
of that is because I've been presenting at conferences now for seven years. Um,
having a little bit of fame is quite helpful, because you don't have to prove
yourself when people come up and say: "Oh, you're Trisha Gee, I saw you talking
about..." but I don't have to start with: "I'm Tricia. I am a real programmer,"
right? Yeah. So I built up that portfolio. It is a public
portfolio. So that, that does help. I do a bunch of screencasts now as well on
YouTube. And, and so I'm showing how to, how to demo the IDE, but also I've had
an opportunity, particularly now, as a developer advocate, I've spoken to way
more developers than you do when you're working inside a small team.
So when you're working inside a team, like you. You have to prove yourself when
you join a team, this is true of anybody. It doesn't matter what color you are
or what race you are or what gender you are. When you join a team, you are
having a, again, it's like a dating thing. You're getting to know them.
They're getting to know you. You want to, you want to start with your best self
and say: "look, I'm good at all these things", you know, you want to prove
yourself when you joined the team that's normal. Then once you get into that
position, they should accept you and you should feel comfortable being part of
that team.
But. You're you've only had to do it to like half a dozen people or 20 people
maybe or whatever. Um, and every time you move on to a new team, you have to do
the same thing again and again, as a developer advocate, I get to speak to way
more developers now. So I just, at the conferences, you speak to like 20 people
at one conference and. You no longer feel the need to be like: "Hey, I'm
Tricia, I'm a real programmer." You just can't start off with, like: "I know by
now I know I'm a real programmer, right? I've spoken to a lot of you. I know
what your problems are. Not all of them, obviously, but I've heard, you know, a
lot of people saying, I don't know how to do this thing."
And I'm like: "Oh, I know that!" Well, what about this stuff? And I'm like: "Oh,
I know the answer to that." Or how do you think about that? And I'm like: "Oh, I
don't know anything about that. But I do know someone who does know that thing,"
or I do know which words to Google to find that out. So having spoken to lots of
people and having much better idea of what my strengths and weaknesses are,
it makes me much more comfortable with, with being me. Like I no longer feel the
urge to go into if I go into, um, a big technical conference, maybe, you know?
Well, there's one that I know well, and I don't need to prove myself, but if
there's one, let's say I go into JavaScript conference, I'll be much more
uncomfortable because I don't know anything about JavaScript.
But I do know that I know a lot about Java. I do know about technical
presentation skills. I do know a lot about our IDE's and I'm comfortable now with
what I know and what I don't know. And that gives me that, you know, people come
up to me and go: "Oh, well, that's a really stupid way to write a JavaScript
statement." I'm like: "yeah. Okay. If you tell me that's true. I don't know
anything about JavaScript." If someone comes up to me and says: "that's a stupid
way to do that thing in Java", I'm like: "well, you've got your way. I've got my
way, whatever."

**Michaela:**: [00:36:48] Yeah. I think maybe it has also a little bit to do
with growing pain. Right?
So every time you're moving, you're changing something. You're shaking things
up. You are in new territory and you have to somehow prove yourself also to
yourself. Then, you know, you. You know what you're talking about. Right. So
I think, for example, for me leaving Microsoft meant also leaving sort of some
of the Microsoft technologies behind. And now I'm, I'm looking at, for example,
the startup scenes and different, you know, it's, it's, it's actually my tech
bubble that I'm right now in, and it's a lot of JavaScript, a lot of React
that's going on there. Right. And I'm like: "I have no idea about react and it
really bugs me." It's like: "Oh my God, something is missing. I cannot, you
know, I don't know what people are talking about." So now it's on
my list that I have to learn that. And, um, and I think it has to do with this
growing pain that you are changing, that you are doing something new, as you
said, like you're doing. Your thing already for quite some time. So you're
settled and you're knowing that, you know, the things and, um...

**Trisha:**: [00:37:48] Yeah. And I think part of that as well is that one of
the, one of my sweet spots. So one of the things that I've been, um, have made
my area is the new, new upcoming bits of Java. So I know if I'm like right on
that straight away, There's just almost no one knows that stuff. Cause it's
brand new. The only people who know, who know it better than me are people
who read way more than me or the Oracle developers themselves.
So that's also a benefit. Whereas if I'm going into something like, um, like
Spring is a problem for me, for example, I don't really know the Spring, Spring
framework very well. I've used it a bunch, but I know there are lots of people
out there who use it all the time and they use it in their way. So yeah, like if
I was going to be, when I was doing my Spring demo last year, Had a certain
element of, I've either got to read like everything to, to get to know this
really well.
Or I've got to put myself into that mindset, the sort of beginner's mindset of,
okay, this seems to be the most effective way to do this. It appears to work.
Like, but there are plenty of other ways to do stuff.

**Michaela:**: [00:38:46] Yeah, yeah. Yeah. That's true. So one of the things
that I wanted to talk with you about is the development processes at JetBrains.
JetBrains is definitely one of the companies that I always think about I'm
applying and working there. So if I applied there, how would, you know, how
would the development process look like? What, you know, what would I do? Would
I write code what I have, you know, a test environment. We have testers there,
you know, how does that all work?

**Trisha:**: [00:39:14] Um, so JetBrains, I don't know if a JetBrains is unique,
but JetBrains is, is a very interesting sort of organization in that it's very
developer driven. The people who started the organization were developers and
they created an IDE for them as developers. So everything, everyone from the
bottom up is, is basically a developer.
Um, it's interesting for me because, um, I've worked one of what to large
organizations, they're all quite command and control-y. So you kind of, you, you
know, there's like a hierarchy to navigate, to, to, to ask questions or to, to
feed stuff back JetBrains doesn't really work like that. It's more like, um, It's
more like a network.
It's more like a sort of ecosystem. We've got a thousand over a thousand people
working at JetBrains. Um, but really everyone's still only like two levels away
from the CEO is really flat. Like my boss is Hattie and Hattie is he reports
directly to the CEO.

**Michaela:**: [00:40:06] Oh wow, I was reading about that, yeah.

**Trisha:**: [00:40:08] Yeah. And, and my team is like 20 well. So now I'm, I'm
a team lead of, of the Java advocacy team.
So I Malheur reports to me. So we have like a tiny team. Um, but the, the
developer advocacy team has like 20 people who report effectively to sort Patty
who has his boss and. The same to some extent with the other developers. So I
think there's something like 300 developers on intelligent idea, but I don't
think, I don't think that's like in some sort of really strict hierarchy.
And I kind of know it's not in a strict hierarchy because the way I interact
with the, with the developers, cause I don't develop on intelligent
specifically myself, is that I'm usually doing a video or a blog post on like,
what are the new features unintelligent I did? And the way I like to approach
those is not like, here's, here's the button, click this, do this.
It's like, okay, what is this feature? How would it help me as a developer to
get to do the thing I'm trying to, trying to do? Like, I don't really care about
what the feature looks like. I care about what I want to use it for. I'm always
trying to come up with these videos and blogs to say: "let's say we have this
sort of problem.
This is the feature that will help you fix that problem." But often when I'm
doing those, I have to, to figure out what the feature is, how it works and what
sorts of problems it solves. And in order to do that, I usually speak to the
individual developer who created that feature. Like, I don't, I don't have like
a single point of contact.
And when I'm asking them, like: "why did you develop this?" They're like: "well,
it just, it was a problem I had, so I fixed it. Or it seemed like a good idea
at the time, you know?" So a lot of, a lot of the organization, they, um, the
developers. They are dog fooding the product because they write intelligent idea
and they're using intelligent idea to write intelligent idea.
And they're using Kotlin in intelligent idea to write intelligent idea. So
Kotlin and, and intelligent idea, or kind of, um, there's got the symbiotic
relationship because the developers are like: "Oh, wouldn't it be nice if we had
an inspection, which showed us when the code looks like this?" So that's why
the IDE particularly for, for Java, 'cause they intelligent idea code base
is still has a good chunk of Java as well as some Kotlin and stuff.
You know, the intelligent idea, Java features are always just expanding
ridiculously because our developers go: "oh, this would make my life easier."
And that really helps to really helps with our users because they're like: "Oh,
that makes my life easier too." But so, yeah, so we do a lot of dog fooding. It
seems to me there's a certain level of the developers can kind of more or less
pick what they want to work on. This year we've actually got a roadmap.
So we have a product roadmap and the plan is to kind of try and do features,
which go towards that product roadmap. But I think this is the first year I've
ever seen a product roadmap. Usually it's much more if it's, if it exists, it's
much more informal. So the development organization is, is very, um, it's kind
of where I think a lot of developers would like to work.
It's kind of like, we just kind of trust you to get on with your job and just,
just do it. Yeah. And they're, so they're all like they're all code work. Well,
a lot of them, most of the intelligent idea develop because our in St.
Petersburg where we have a big office, we have a bunch in Munich as well, where
we have our European development office, but then all of the developer
advocates, all of us, there's like 20 of us.
We're all remote. And we all work. So I'm working from the South of Spain.
Yeah. Mali is in India had, he's actually had, he's only about two hours away in
Malaga, but we have never, ever met up in Spain ever in the Lake seven years
known him. And we always meet in like London or Amsterdam or New York or so, or
St. Petersburg or Munich as it.
But yeah. There's people in the States, people in the UK.

**Michaela:**: [00:43:26] So, yeah. Traveling a lot as well.

**Trisha:**: [00:43:27] Well, not right now. (laughs)

**Michaela:**: [00:43:30] Yeah. That's what I wanted to ask you about. What are
you doing right now? What does an develop an advocate do during a pandemic?

**Trisha:**: [00:43:37] Oh, so yeah, this, this is. There's one good side of
this, which is that I'm working on a lot of content.
I'm doing a lot of blog posts and videos. So I don't really have a boss who
tells me what to do. I have like an internal customer who gives me suggestions
on things she'd like, and she's always sort of saying: "well, we need these
videos." And she's been saying for like three years: "we need these 42 videos."
And I'm like: "yeah, I guess I'm averaging about three years. It's gonna take
awhile to get around to doing them." And in the last like three weeks or so, I've
done three videos already and then way more videos. More blog posts. I'd already
cut down my travel a bit. This year. I'd only committed to six events.
Um, and usually do sort of eight to 12 events. Something like that. To be
honest, I'm really happy I'm not traveling this year. I just really, I just, I
think I really liked the travel. I really liked the conferences I worked
remotely and, uh, and I live in Spain where I don't really get out very much and
speak to people in Spanish, out here very much. So I like conferences cause I
get to go out and connect with human beings and do stuff.
But my kids are two and four now. Um, one of them is at school and I just really
don't need to be jetting off every two weeks or so to spend four days. I'm not,
I don't spend four days conference. You spend like a day getting there. Day,
prepping a day, give it like an hour giving the presentation, another day doing
whatever else.
And then another day getting back and you just you're like: "I just gave an hour
long presentation. It just seems like a massive waste of my time." So I will be
doing some more virtual events, more webinars, but honestly, I'm just really
looking forward to doing more writing and more video stuff right now.

**Michaela:**: [00:45:06] Yeah. Yeah. I can't imagine. And I can totally relate.
My kids are also two and four as a yeah. You're talking about. Okay, Trisha.
So thank you so much for, for being on my show today, we talked about so many
things. Is there something that we haven't covered that you would like to, you
know, let my listeners know, or you know, that you want to throw out?

**Trisha:**: [00:45:25] So, yeah, we are hiring and other Java developer
advocate. Um, if anyone is interested in playing, I didn't actually talk that
much about developer advocacy hiring process. So I got hired. But without a
process because I was already well known. Our hiring process is we, well, first
you have to apply. If you don't apply, we can't interview you and you will be
interviewed by me and an HR person.
You will usually have to submit a, uh, as an example, post, it could be
something you've already written. If you already have blog posts and example,
screencast or video, if you've already got one, that's great too. I mostly want
to look for evidence that you can use intelligent idea and you know, what the
IDE is for.
And it's not just a text highlighter, you understand, using the keyboard to
navigate you understand life templates, shortcuts, all of those sorts of things.
Yeah. Yeah. And then, uh, and then mostly the most important thing for me is
probably gonna be team fit because Mattie and I, we work quite well together and
I'm just looking for a third person, like I'm nominally in charge of the team,
but I just really want us the three of us, whoever we are.
To work well together, to gel well, to be able to compliment each other in our
skills. So for example, I'm not looking for someone who's an expert in, in Java,
in like cutting edge Java stuff, because me and Matt have both got that. Like we
both are on top of the new versions of Java and I'm not looking for someone
who's necessarily going to be a very experienced developer advocate because I've
got some experience. I've got plenty of experience. Matt has got some
experience. We can help teach a lot of that stuff. I am looking for someone with
complimentary skills. For example, I know nothing about AWS or cloud or Docker or
any of that stuff. And I would really love someone who understood that stuff.

**Michaela:**: [00:47:06] And so, if somebody wants to apply, they should write
an email directly to you or go to JetBrains, uh, slash and jobs, and then apply
there. Or how does that work?

**Trisha:**: [00:47:18] I'm just having a look at this. You'll probably hear me
typing. I think it's JetBrains. Yeah. jetbrains.com/careers.

**Michaela:**: [00:47:25] Careers. Okay.

**Trisha:**: [00:47:27] Um, and there, you should be able to look for a developer
advocacy role. They are sometimes listed as being, as having an office location,
but they're not, they're fully remote. I think the office location might be just
literally, um, you know, like a, a thing. The system makes you put in there. So
developer advocacy roles are they're fully remote.
Ideally we'd like someone in North America because we don't have someone
covering that geography and time zone. But, um, yeah, it's a fully remote
position.

**Michaela:**: [00:47:51] Okay. Okay, cool. Very cool. So thank you so much for
taking the time to talk with me today. I hope you enjoy the rest of the day and,
um, thank you so much, Trisha.

**Trisha:**: [00:48:00] Thank you. It's my pleasure. Bye.
